# Environment Variable Manager

A text based password manager with version history.

Okay, here's the idea. It stores secret in text files in a repository structure similar to git. You have the ability to sync with a server,
manage access, and share secrets, view secrets history and edit it in the browser or cli. Since it syncs with the cloud, it's going to
be e2e encrypted.
