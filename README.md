# Environment Variable Manager

The concept is a password manager that is based on text and has a version history. It stores confidential information in text files using a repository structure similar to that of Git. The password manager allows you to synchronize the data with a server, manage access, share secrets, view the history of secrets, and edit them through a browser or command-line interface. The application also features end-to-end encryption, as it synchronizes with the cloud.
