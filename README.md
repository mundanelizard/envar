# Environment Variable Manager

A text based password manager with version history.

Okay, here's the idea. It stores all the key values pair secrets in a repository structure similar to git. You have the ability to sync with a server,
manage access, and share environment files, view secrets history and edit it in the browser or cli. Since it is sync with the cloud, it's going to
be e2e. Encryption will take place locally and only the vault will be sent to the cloud. Decryption will also take place on the user device.
