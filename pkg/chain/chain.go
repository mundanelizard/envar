package chain

// The inspiration for chain is drawn from github.com/justinas/alice. I decided to write my version instead of using the
// official alice version because they've been no updates in the past 2 years even though issues and PR has been made on the repo.
// I'm scared it might be dead, and it's a very simple and light feature to implement, so I guess it's not bad if I do it :)
